# COVID-19-India-Data-Visualization
"Visualization and analysis of India's COVID-19 data for 2020 using Python, Pandas, and Power BI."


# 📌 Project Overview
Comprehensive analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data for India in 2020. This project covers the entire data lifecycle: sourcing, cleaning, transformation with Python and Pandas, and building an interactive dashboard using Power BI and DAX for detailed state-wise and summary insights.

# 🔄 Project Workflow
COVID-19 data source ➡️ Data cleaning & transformation (Python, Pandas) ➡️ Export to CSV/Excel ➡️ Power BI dashboard reporting ➡️ Interactive KPI analysis

# 📊 Dataset
Columns: Confirmed Cases, Deceased, Active, Delta Confirmed, Tests per Positive Case, Positive Rate, State, Date, and more.

Source: Public COVID-19 datasets (India2020)

Format: CSV/Excel post-cleaning.

# 🔧 Steps Involved
-> Data cleaning and preparation using Pandas in Jupyter (removal of duplicates, type conversions, accuracy validation)

-> Exploratory data analysis to review key COVID-19 metrics and identify trends

-> Imported cleaned data into Power BI

-> Added calculated columns, created DAX measures for metrics like positivity rate

-> Built a six-page interactive Power BI report: slicers, KPIs, line charts, maps, and summary views

-> Implemented drill-down and filters for granular and interactive analysi
